# Space-Infestation
Space infestation is a spaceship shooter game where you play as an invading alien that destroys planets by spreading the infestation of the eye. You as the invader must infest planets and fight off repelling space forces that were sent by the planetary defense.

The game is made in Unity written in C#. All the Assets in the game excluding sound effects are made by me using GIMP (sprites), and VSC as the IDE.
